‚òùÔ∏è Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
Silent auctions are a popular fundraiser for many different kinds of organizations, especially charities. This app will allow sellers and bidders to connect together in one place and allow for bidders to see items and place bids on them without having to physically be there.
Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
MVP

1. Create two types of users: Sellers and bidders
2. Bidders can upload an image, description, and starting price of an item
3. Bidders can see all items and place bids on them.
4. Auctions show the time bidding ends
5. All bids show next to the item and shows who made the bid
   STRETCH
6. App does not allow bids when the auction is over
7. Bidders can remain anonymous on the front end, but still need to be identified by the seller when the auction is over.
8. Support for multiple auctions at once.
9. Stripe integration to pay for items.

What is the mission statement?
To provide access to auctions for various charity events.
